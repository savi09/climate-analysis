# climate-analysis
SQLAlchemy, Pandas and Matplotlib was used to perform the following analysis.

* Determine the last day data was entered (August 23, 2017).
* Retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data from the last day data was entered to plot the data. Example below.

* Description of the percipitation data: the number of records (2015), average percipitation (0.18 in), standard deviation (0.46), minimum percipitation(0 in), percipitation data quartiles, and maximum percipitation (6.7 in).
